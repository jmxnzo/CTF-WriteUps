# Collection of CTF Write-Ups 

This repository is a collection of CTF Write-Ups, used for own documention purposes. It may serve as a helpful guide regarding some similar CTF challenges.
I do all my documentation in obsidian(https://obsidian.md/). For the easiest reading experience, just open the github repo in your obsidian vault. 
All of the code snippets, created during the solving process of the CTFs can be found in the /Code folder of this repo. 
Enjoy!
